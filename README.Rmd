# DRLm

The `DRLm` package provides a collection of dose-response functions designed for integration with the `qraLm` package. It simplifies microbial risk assessment by offering tools for modeling and analysis of dose-response relationships, with an initial focus on Listeria monocytogenes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `DRLm` from the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/DRLm](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/DRLm)) using the `devtools` package:

- Install the devtools package if not already installed

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

- Install the DRLm package from GitHub

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("WorldHealthOrganization/DRLm")
```
