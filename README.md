# DRLm

The `DRLm` package provides a collection of dose-response functions
designed for integration with the `qraLm` package. It simplifies
microbial risk assessment by offering tools for modeling and analysis of
dose-response relationships, with an initial focus on Listeria
monocytogenes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `DRLm` from the GitHub
repository (<https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/DRLm>) using the
`devtools` package:

- Install the devtools package if not already installed

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

- Install the DRLm package from GitHub

``` r
devtools::install_github("WorldHealthOrganization/DRLm")
```
